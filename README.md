## >_ The Philosophy

**Intent** bridges the gap between perception and reality. It uses **Sentence Transformers (SBERT)** to translate natural language requests (e.g., *"get job applications"*) into protocol actions across your email providers. It condenses the flood of digital communication into a single, focused view.

## >_ Features

### 👂 Active Listeners
Stop refreshing. Start listening.
> **Intent** allows you to spawn background daemons that actively listen for incoming mail from specific high-priority groups or threads. It converts complex noise patterns into clear, actionable signals.

### 🔍 Semantic Filters
Context over keywords.
> Powered by local LLMs, the **Filter** engine scans your inbox respecting your *semantic rules*. It understands that "urgent" might mean a server crash log or a message from your CTO, filtering out the marketing fluff that keywords alone can't catch.
